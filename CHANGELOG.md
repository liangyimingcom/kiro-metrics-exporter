# Changelog

All notable changes to the Kiro Metrics Exporter extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Stats dropped to zero for sessions after May 7, 2026, because Kiro changed execution-log tool names from camelCase (`fsWrite`/`strReplace`) to snake_case (`fs_write`/`str_replace`). The extractor now normalizes both naming conventions, so historical and new logs are counted consistently.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Upload Today command and toolbar button for uploading current day metrics
- Upload Today button appears leftmost in the toolbar

### Changed

- Auto-upload enabled by default (`metricsExporter.autoUpload.enabled` default changed from `false` to `true`)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Auto-upload feature with configurable interval (`metricsExporter.autoUpload.enabled`, default: false)
- Configurable auto-upload interval in hours (`metricsExporter.autoUpload.intervalHours`, default: 8, range: 1-168)
- Auto-upload performs an immediate upload on startup, then repeats at the configured interval
- Auto-upload runs in silent mode (no popup notifications, logs only)
- Timer restarts automatically when auto-upload settings change

### Fixed

- Extension ID corrected from `undefined_publisher` to `DiscreteTom`
